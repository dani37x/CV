# CV/PORTFOLIO
**Creator, where user can make CV/PORTFOLIO with own colors and data.**

*work in progress*

I wanted create this project in many different versions, like you can see for example in files 'forms.py' and 'database.py'. I decided do not delete those files, because I have idea for future to add new database with login and flask authenticator.

In some files I want add some things, but almost everything is done what I wanted show in this project in backend. 

I create own pages (html, css) to show my frontend basic skills to work with backend.

During near two weeks I am going to teach Django and start new project, but I should add new functions to CV-maker.

In requirements.txt you can see all libraries versions.
